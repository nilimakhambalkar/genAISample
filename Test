### **JIRA Story: Moniker Registration - Save Moniker**

**Story Title:**
Moniker Registration - Implement Save Moniker Functionality

**Story Description:**
As a user, I want to be able to save the moniker during the Moniker Registration process, so that all entered information is securely stored and can be retrieved for further processing.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Save Moniker Action:**
   - Given a user has completed filling out the Moniker Registration form,
   - When the user clicks the "Save" button,
   - Then the system should save the moniker data into the database.

2. **Validation Before Save:**
   - Given the user has filled out the registration form,
   - When the user attempts to save the moniker,
   - Then all required fields must pass validation (e.g., required fields are completed, data formats are correct).
   - If validation fails, appropriate error messages should be displayed, and the moniker should not be saved.

3. **Successful Save Notification:**
   - Given the moniker data has been saved successfully,
   - When the save process is complete,
   - Then a success message should be displayed confirming that the moniker has been saved.

4. **Error Handling for Save:**
   - If there is an error during the save process (e.g., network issues, database errors),
   - Then the system should display an appropriate error message to the user and allow them to attempt the save again.

5. **Partial Save (Optional):**
   - Given the user has partially completed the form,
   - When they click the "Save" button,
   - Then the system should save all currently entered data so that the user can return later to complete the registration.

6. **Retrieval of Saved Moniker Data:**
   - Given a user is returning to complete the registration,
   - When the user accesses the saved moniker,
   - Then the system should pre-populate the registration form with the previously saved data.

7. **Access Control:**
   - Only authorized users should be able to save monikers in the system, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented.

8. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - The save functionality should be thoroughly tested to ensure data is saved correctly and validation works as intended.
   - Performance testing should ensure the save process is efficient.
