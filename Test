**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Moniker List Display:**
   - Given the user accesses the Moniker Inventory page,
   - When the page loads,
   - Then the system should display a comprehensive list of all available monikers, including relevant details such as name, description, status, and any associated metadata.

2. **Sorting and Filtering Options:**
   - The user should have the ability to sort the moniker list by different columns (e.g., name, status).
   - The user should also be able to filter the list based on specific criteria (e.g., active/inactive status, category).

3. **Search Functionality:**
   - The system should include a search bar to allow users to quickly find specific monikers by entering keywords.

4. **Pagination:**
   - If the list of monikers exceeds a certain number, the display should support pagination to improve user experience and performance.
   - Users should be able to navigate through pages of monikers easily.

5. **Detail View:**
   - Given a user clicks on a moniker from the list,
   - When the moniker details are requested,
   - Then the system should display a detailed view of the selected moniker, showing all relevant information.

6. **Access Control:**
   - The moniker list should respect user permissions, displaying only the monikers that the user is authorized to view.

7. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - The moniker list functionality should be tested to ensure correct data display, sorting, filtering, and search operations.
