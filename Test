### **JIRA Story: OUTPUT Adjustments - Download - Create Request Payload for RunID or Without RunID**

**Story Title:**
OUTPUT Adjustments - Create Request Payload for Download with or without RunID as per Service Team Request

**Story Description:**
As a developer, I need to create a request payload for OUTPUT Adjustments download functionality, which accommodates both scenarios—when a RunID is provided and when it is not—based on the service team's specifications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Payload Creation with RunID:**
   - Given a valid RunID is available,
   - When the system generates the download request,
   - Then the request payload should include the RunID in the format specified by the service team.
   - The system should return the corresponding data for that RunID.

2. **Payload Creation without RunID:**
   - Given no RunID is provided,
   - When the system generates the download request,
   - Then the request payload should be structured accordingly, without the RunID, and still adhere to the service team's specifications.
   - The system should return data for all relevant entries in the absence of a RunID.

3. **Error Handling for Invalid RunID:**
   - Given an invalid or malformed RunID is provided,
   - When the system generates the download request,
   - Then the system should return an error response indicating the issue with the RunID.

4. **Service Team Specifications Compliance:**
   - The request payload, with or without RunID, must strictly follow the format and requirements outlined by the service team.

5. **Logging and Auditing:**
   - All request payloads (with or without RunID) should be logged for auditing purposes, capturing the details of the request made.

6. **Performance Metrics:**
   - The system must process and respond to the download request within acceptable performance limits, regardless of whether the payload contains a RunID or not.
