### **JIRA Story: OUTPUT Adjustments - Download API Integration and End-to-End Testing for With and Without RunID**

**Story Title:**
OUTPUT Adjustments - Integrate Download API and Perform End-to-End Testing for With and Without RunID

**Story Description:**
As a developer, I need to integrate the Download API for OUTPUT Adjustments to support both scenarios—requests with RunID and without RunID—and perform comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure proper functionality, data accuracy, and error handling.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **API Integration for Download with RunID:**
   - Given the API is integrated,
   - When a request is made with a valid RunID,
   - Then the system should retrieve and return the corresponding data related to that specific RunID.

2. **API Integration for Download without RunID:**
   - Given the API is integrated,
   - When a request is made without a RunID,
   - Then the system should retrieve and return all relevant data, as per the specifications.

3. **Error Handling for Invalid RunID:**
   - Given the API is integrated,
   - When an invalid or malformed RunID is provided,
   - Then the system should return an appropriate error message and handle the request failure gracefully.

4. **End-to-End Testing for with RunID:**
   - Given the Download API is integrated,
   - When end-to-end testing is performed with a valid RunID,
   - Then the system should successfully generate the request, retrieve the correct data, and display it appropriately.

5. **End-to-End Testing for without RunID:**
   - Given the Download API is integrated,
   - When end-to-end testing is performed without a RunID,
   - Then the system should successfully generate the request and retrieve all relevant data, displaying it accurately.

6. **Response Time:**
   - The Download API should return data for both with and without RunID requests within acceptable response times, without causing delays or timeouts.

7. **Audit and Logging:**
   - All download requests (both with and without RunID) should be logged for auditing purposes, capturing details of the requests, responses, and any errors encountered.

8. **Data Accuracy:**
   - The data returned by the Download API should match the expected output for both cases (with and without RunID) during end-to-end testing.

9. **Compliance with Service Team Specifications:**
   - The download requests (with and without RunID) must adhere to the format and data structure required by the service team.
