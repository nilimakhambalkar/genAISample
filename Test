!### **JIRA Story: Model Registration Dynamic Form Creation**

**Story Title:**
Create a Dynamic Form for Model Registration

**Story Description:**
As a product owner, I want to develop a dynamic form for Model Registration that adjusts based on user input to ensure that users can provide the necessary information efficiently and accurately.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Dynamic Field Generation:**
   - Given the user accesses the Model Registration form,
   - When the user selects certain options (e.g., model type, category),
   - Then the form should dynamically generate relevant fields based on the selected options.

2. **Field Validation:**
   - All dynamically generated fields must have appropriate validation rules based on the type of data expected (e.g., required fields, format checks).
   - Given the user submits the form,
   - When validation fails,
   - Then clear error messages should be displayed next to the relevant fields.

3. **Pre-population of Fields:**
   - Given a user returns to the form,
   - When they have previously submitted or partially filled out the form,
   - Then the form should pre-populate any fields with the previously entered data.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - The dynamic form must have a clean and intuitive design to enhance user experience.
   - Ensure that the layout is responsive and accessible across different devices.

5. **Data Submission:**
   - Given the user has completed the form,
   - When they click the submit button,
   - Then the form data should be correctly sent to the backend for processing and confirmation of successful submission should be displayed.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - The system should handle any errors that occur during form submission gracefully and provide informative feedback to the user.

7. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - The dynamic form must be tested across different scenarios to ensure all fields generate correctly based on various user inputs, and validation rules are enforced accurately.
