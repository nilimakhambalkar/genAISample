### **JIRA Story: Moniker Inventory - Add Create, Update, and Delete Moniker Actions**

**Story Title:**
Implement Create, Update, and Delete Actions for Moniker Inventory

**Story Description:**
As an inventory manager, I want to be able to create, update, and delete monikers in the Moniker Inventory system so that I can effectively manage the moniker data as required.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Create Moniker Action:**
   - Given the user accesses the Moniker Inventory page,
   - When the user clicks on the "Create Moniker" button,
   - Then a form should appear for the user to enter the necessary details (e.g., name, description, category, status).
   - Upon submission, the new moniker should be added to the inventory and visible in the moniker list.

2. **Update Moniker Action:**
   - Given a user selects an existing moniker from the list,
   - When they click on the "Update" button,
   - Then the current details of the moniker should be pre-filled in a form for editing.
   - Upon submission of the updated details, the moniker should be updated in the inventory and reflect the changes in the list.

3. **Delete Moniker Action:**
   - Given a user selects a moniker from the list,
   - When they click on the "Delete" button,
   - Then the system should prompt the user for confirmation before deletion.
   - If confirmed, the moniker should be removed from the inventory and no longer visible in the moniker list.

4. **Validation for Create/Update:**
   - The system should enforce validation rules to ensure that required fields are completed and that data formats are correct before allowing the creation or updating of a moniker.
   - Appropriate error messages should be displayed for any validation failures.

5. **Success and Error Notifications:**
   - Upon successful creation, update, or deletion, the system should display a success message.
   - If an error occurs during any action, the system should provide a clear error message to inform the user of the issue.

6. **Access Control:**
   - The ability to create, update, or delete monikers should be restricted based on user roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can perform these actions.

7. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Thorough testing should be conducted to verify that all actions (create, update, delete) work as intended and that proper validations and notifications are in place.
