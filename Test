### **JIRA Story: Moniker Registration - Integrate Dynamic Form in Moniker Registration**

**Story Title:**
Integrate Dynamic Form in Moniker Registration

**Story Description:**
As a user, I want a dynamic form integrated into the Moniker Registration process, so that the form adapts based on input selections, allowing for a more efficient and streamlined registration experience.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Dynamic Form Integration:**
   - Given a user begins the Moniker Registration process,
   - When the form is loaded,
   - Then the form fields should dynamically adjust based on the user's input (e.g., selecting a moniker type should reveal fields specific to that type).

2. **Conditional Field Display:**
   - Fields within the registration form should only appear when relevant based on prior selections.
   - For example, if a specific category is chosen, additional fields relevant to that category should display.

3. **Validation of Dynamic Fields:**
   - Each dynamically generated field should have proper validation (e.g., required fields, data formats) to ensure the accuracy of the input.
   - Error messages should be displayed near any field with incorrect or missing data.

4. **Real-Time Form Updates:**
   - As the user progresses through the form and makes changes to selections,
   - The system should update the form in real time without needing to refresh the page.

5. **Form Pre-Population (Optional):**
   - Given a user is returning to the form after starting it previously,
   - When the form loads,
   - Then it should pre-populate fields with the data already provided by the user.

6. **Seamless Data Submission:**
   - Upon form completion and submission, the system should capture all the user-provided data accurately and send it to the backend for further processing.

7. **Error Handling and Notifications:**
   - If an error occurs during form submission, a clear and concise message should be displayed to the user, explaining what went wrong.
   - Upon successful submission, the user should receive a confirmation message.

8. **Access Control and Permissions:**
   - The dynamic
