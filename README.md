Subject: Request to Add Authentication & Authorization in Next PR

Hi [Project Manager’s Name],

I wanted to bring up an important security enhancement for our application. Currently, the application is in production with basic authentication but without authorization.

To improve security and access control, I recommend adding authentication and authorization features in the next PR. Here’s why this is crucial:

Importance of Adding Authentication & Authorization:
	1.	Enhanced Security – Prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive data.
	2.	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Ensures users only access what they are permitted to.
	3.	Compliance & Best Practices – Helps meet security standards and regulatory requirements.
	4.	Prevention of Unauthorized Actions – Reduces the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized modifications.
	5.	Improved User Management – Allows us to manage access levels effectively across different user roles.

I’d like to discuss the best approach to implementing this in our next release. Please let me know a convenient time to go over the details.
