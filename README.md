Feedback & Recommendations Based on Ratings

1. Drive (Rated 3)

Feedback Summary:
	•	Demonstrates motivation and eagerness to learn.
	•	Takes initiative in projects, but could further push beyond expectations.
	•	Can enhance drive by proactively identifying more opportunities for innovation.

Recommendations:
✔ Set ambitious goals beyond assigned tasks (e.g., proposing new optimizations or automation).
✔ Demonstrate ownership by taking the lead in troubleshooting and suggesting innovative solutions.
✔ Seek feedback actively and work on continuous improvement.

⸻

2. Technical Question 1 (Rated 3)

Feedback Summary:
	•	Answered effectively but could improve clarity and depth in explanations.
	•	Could include real-world examples or more technical details when responding.

Recommendations:
✔ Practice concise, structured answers using the STAR method for technical questions.
✔ Use relevant projects or past experiences to support technical explanations.
✔ Highlight efficiency improvements (e.g., query optimization reducing execution time).

⸻

3. Technical Question 2 (Rated 3)

Feedback Summary:
	•	Showed good problem-solving skills but could improve in speed and confidence.
	•	Could elaborate on the scalability and efficiency of the solution.

Recommendations:
✔ Improve response confidence by practicing coding problems under time constraints.
✔ Discuss trade-offs and alternative approaches when answering technical questions.
✔ If unsure, think out loud to showcase reasoning instead of staying silent.

⸻

4. Technical Question 3 (Rated 3)

Feedback Summary:
	•	Provided a working solution but could have explained edge cases better.
	•	Lacked some optimization discussion in the answer.

Recommendations:
✔ Cover edge cases when explaining a solution.
