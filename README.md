Next Year’s UI Work for EBA DCC Project:

	1.	EBA Tax Calculation
	•	Description: A completely new feature, which is still in the early stages with no formal discussions started yet. However, it is expected to involve significant UI work for tax calculations within the EBA system. The UI team will need to develop new forms, input screens, and visual elements to support the tax calculation logic.
	2.	Model Data Capture
	•	Description: Continue working on pending tasks carried over from P12. This will likely include UI updates for better data input, storage visualization, and data validation screens that assist users in capturing model data more efficiently.
	3.	Input Data Adjustment
	•	Description: This new feature requires enhancements to the current output data adjustment screen. The existing interface will need to be modified to handle new input adjustment functionality, streamlining the process for users to interact with both the old and new data. This will also involve working on user flows, validations, and error handling.
	4.	4x Key Algorithm
	•	Description: The UI team will develop a completely new module that supports the 4x mapping feature. This will require designing an interface for users to map and adjust key algorithms, with functionality for data input, visual representation of mapping, and error checking.
	5.	POST Launchpad
	•	Description: A multi-part task that involves:
	•	Developing new screens based on revised requirements, ensuring they are intuitive and user-friendly.
	•	Building an admin interface for managing backend settings and configurations.
	•	Implementing a Banner CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system, allowing users to manage banners within the platform.
	•	Notification development to alert users of system updates, reminders, or data changes in real-time.
	6.	Workflow Execution and History
	•	Description: Several enhancements and changes will be required in this area:
	•	Block and model updates that support a more seamless workflow execution.
	•	EBA-specific workflow changes to better align with evolving business requirements.
	•	Adjustments to workflow execution screens to handle both input and output data more efficiently, with an improved interface for tracking history and auditing tasks.
	7.	CCAR Support
	•	Description: In 2024, the UI team is expected to address between 7 to 10 key issues related to the CCAR project. These tasks will focus on:
	•	Merging and adopting CCAR updates into the current system.
	•	Providing ongoing support for access, deployment, and UI troubleshooting during the integration process.
	8.	RRP
	•	Description: The UI team will fix a total of 5 issues related to the RRP (Resolution and Recovery Planning) in 2024. These will involve bug fixes, UI tweaks, and system improvements to ensure better user interaction. Additionally, support will be provided for access and deployment tasks.
	9.	Climate
	•	Description: UI work related to the PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) changes will be a focus in 2024. This will include updates to the climate data modules, adjusting UI elements to reflect new carbon accounting standards, and providing ongoing support for any UI-related issues that arise during the transition.
	10.	Performance Optimization
	•	Description: A key focus will be on optimizing the performance of the user interface, ensuring faster load times and responsiveness. This will involve code refactoring, reducing the number of HTTP requests, and improving data caching. Testing will be performed across various devices, browsers, and screen resolutions to ensure consistent performance for all users.
	11.	Accessibility Improvements
	•	Description: UI updates will be made to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). This includes improvements to screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast adjustments, and making all visual and interactive elements more inclusive to users with disabilities.
	12.	UI/UX Design Enhancements
	•	Description: Revamping the current UI in accordance with updated brand guidelines and enhancing the overall user experience. This will include redesigning key screens, improving user flows, and simplifying complex interactions based on user feedback and usability testing.
	13.	Security Enhancements
	•	Description: The UI team will implement new security features within the interface, including enhanced encryption methods, secure authentication processes (such as multi-factor authentication), and user role management updates to comply with the latest data protection and cybersecurity guidelines.
	14.	Mobile Responsiveness
	•	Description: Work will be done to ensure key modules are fully optimized for mobile devices. This includes redesigning elements to be mobile-friendly, improving touch interactions, and testing across a variety of mobile devices to ensure a seamless experience for users accessing the platform on phones and tablets.
