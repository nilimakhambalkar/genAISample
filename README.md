If you prefer not to keep UI and service code in the same repository, here are some reasons to justify using separate repositories for each:

	1.	Clear Separation of Concerns: Separate repos help maintain a distinct boundary between frontend and backend code, allowing teams to focus on their respective areas without navigating unrelated files. This separation also supports cleaner architecture and modular design.
	2.	Independent Development Cycles: With separate repos, the UI and service teams can follow independent development, release, and deployment schedules. This is especially useful if the frontend and backend evolve at different paces.
	3.	Reduced Complexity: Each repo will have its own set of dependencies, configurations, and CI/CD pipelines, which can reduce the complexity for developers who only need to work on one side (UI or backend). This separation makes the development environment simpler to manage.
	4.	Enhanced Security and Access Control: Separate repositories allow for more granular access controls, ensuring that only the relevant teams have access to specific parts of the codebase. This is beneficial in larger teams where not everyone needs access to both UI and backend code.
	5.	Streamlined Version Control: Each repo can use its own versioning, allowing the backend API to evolve independently of the frontend. This reduces issues with mismatched versions, as dependencies can be managed explicitly through API contracts or documentation.
	6.	Improved Focus for CI/CD Pipelines: Different repos allow each team to create customized CI/CD workflows tailored to the specific needs of the UI or backend. This can lead to faster builds, testing, and deployments by focusing on changes relevant to each repo.
	7.	Smaller Repository Size: As projects grow, having separate repositories helps keep the size of each repo more manageable, leading to faster cloning and reduced disk space usage.

By separating UI and service code into individual repositories, you gain flexibility, maintain clear boundaries, and simplify management, making it easier to scale each component independently.
