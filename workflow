Sure, here's a high-level workflow for your CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review) Streamlit application:

Data Collection and Preprocessing Workflow:

Data Collection: Gather financial data from various sources such as banking systems, APIs, databases, and external data providers.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean, validate, transform, and preprocess the collected financial data. Handle missing values, outliers, and data transformations as needed.
Model Training and Testing Workflow:

Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed financial data into numerical features suitable for training machine learning models.
Model Training: Train machine learning models (e.g., regression models, risk models) using historical financial data and stress test scenarios.
Model Testing and Validation: Validate and test the trained models using historical data, backtesting, and scenario simulations to assess accuracy and performance.
CCAR Stress Testing Workflow:

Scenario Generation: Generate stress test scenarios such as economic downturns, market shocks, credit defaults, interest rate changes, etc.
Stress Test Execution: Perform stress testing using the trained models and generated scenarios to evaluate the bank's capital adequacy and resilience.
Result Analysis: Analyze stress test results, key financial metrics, risk assessments, and impact analysis under different scenarios.
Reporting and Visualization Workflow:

Report Generation: Generate reports, dashboards, and visualizations to present stress test results, financial analysis, trends, and key metrics.
Insights and Recommendations: Provide insights, recommendations, and decision support based on the analysis for regulatory compliance and risk management.
User Interaction Workflow (Streamlit App):

Input Data: Users input financial data, stress test scenarios, and analysis parameters through the Streamlit app's user interface.
Data Processing: Backend services process user inputs, trigger data preprocessing, model training, stress testing, and analysis workflows.
Results Display: Display stress test results, analysis reports, charts, tables, and visualizations in the Streamlit app for user interaction and exploration.
User Feedback and Iteration: Gather user feedback, refine analysis methods, update models, and iterate on the workflow based on user insights and requirements.
Data Storage and Management Workflow:

Data Storage: Store processed financial data, model outputs, stress test results, analysis reports, and user inputs in a centralized database or data repository.
Data Management: Manage data integrity, versioning, security, access control, and compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., data privacy, audit trails).
Deployment and Maintenance Workflow:

Deployment: Deploy the CCAR Streamlit application on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure) using containerization (e.g., Docker) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Monitor application performance, scalability, security, and user feedback. Perform maintenance, updates, and enhancements based on user needs, technology advancements, and regulatory changes.
This workflow outlines the major steps and interactions involved in the CCAR Streamlit application, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, stress testing, reporting, user interaction, data storage, deployment, and maintenance. Each workflow step integrates with the Streamlit app's frontend and backend components to provide a comprehensive financial analysis and stress testing platform for banking institutions.
